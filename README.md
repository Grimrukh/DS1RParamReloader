# DS1RParamReloader
Reload GameParam param tables in DS1R without relaunching the game. 

Thanks to MetalCrow for the CE script and TKGP for `PropertyHook` and `DSR-Gadget`.

Run the EXE and click any GameParam param name to reload it as often as you want without quitting the game.

*DARK SOULS REMASTERED only. Does NOT work for PTDE or any other FromSoftware game.*

DrawParams not yet supported. Also note that some GameParam changes may need "help" for the game to recognize them, as they are sometimes used to compute other things. A save-and-quit might help in many cases.
