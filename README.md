# DS1RParamReloader
Reload GameParam tables in DS1R without relaunching the game. Thanks to MetalCrow for the CE script and TKGP for PropertyHook and DSR-Gadget.

Run the EXE and follow the instructions to choose a GameParam table name and reload it as often as you want without quitting the game.

Does NOT work for PTDE or any other FromSoftware game. DARK SOULS REMASTERED only.

DrawParams not yet supported. Also note that some GameParam changes may need "help" for the game to recognize them, as they are sometimes used to compute other things. A save-and-quit might help in many cases.
